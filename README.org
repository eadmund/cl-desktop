*** Function *~PARSE-DESKTOP-FILE~*
**** Syntax
     *~parse-desktop-file~* _filespec_ → _desktop-file_
**** Arguments and values
- _filespec_ :: a pathname designator
- _desktop-file_ :: an opaque object representing a parsed desktop file
**** Description
*~parse-desktop-file~* reads a single desktop file from disk.  The
return value is currently a naked ordered hash table, but that should
actually change soon; client code should not rely on that.

     *~get-string-key~* _key_ _file_ &key _group_ → _value_
**** Arguments and values
- _key_ :: a string
- _file_ :: a desktop file, as returned from *~parse-desktop-file~*
- _group_ :: a string indicating the group to find the key in; the
  default is "Desktop Entry"
- _value_ :: a string containing the un-escaped value associated with
  _key_, or ~nil~
**** Description
*~get-string-key~* searches _file_ for the indicated key, which must
 indicate a single string value.  If found, any escape sequences are
 replaced and the value is returned.
